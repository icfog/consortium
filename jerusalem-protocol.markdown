This document contains best practices for evaluating FOG according to the *Jerusalem Protocol*.

## Instrumentation

### APDM Opal IMU Apparatus
Five APDM Opal IMUs are required for testing. The provided docking station and software are also required.

### Axivity AX6 sensors
Axivity AX6 sensors (https://axivity.com/product/ax6) are reusable data loggers that patients take home for a brief observation period. They are reusable, but you will need a few extras (once in a while they break). How many depends on how many subjects you anticipate studying at the same time (keep in mind that you need to allow time for the devices to be returned to your center, via mail or courier). With 6, you could study 3 subjects overlapping and have 3 spares.

### Video cameras
Two video cameras on tripods are recommended to record the entirety of each testing session. Any color “Handycam” style video camera that is sufficient for annotating FOG will be appropriate. iPads/tablets tend to blur during fast motion such as festination and are therefore not recommended. Be sure to purchase ample memory.

## Testing protocol

### Space Requirements & Set-up 

#### Kit Included:
Tape, Bluetooth speaker, Box stencil, distance string, measuring tape

Use tape (2.54 cm wide green painters) to mark two squares on the floor (the inside of the box measures 50cm x 50cm), one for the first 5 tasks and one square for walking through a doorway and turning 180 deg. Masking tape square on the floor (50cm x 50 cm) should be at least 30 cm clearance from a wall. Place a chair (with arms) 3m distance from the square for resting between trials when needed and to evaluate FOG during turn to sit maneuver. Place camera 1 (frontal facing) 3m behind the box centered with the chair and be sure the entire subject is in view, including feet during the turn. Place camera 2 (optional, sagittal facing) and 3m to [either] side of the route. Ensure that the camera field of view can view the participants feet and shoulders throughout all parts of the trial.

For task 6 (Doorway), mark the start position on the ground 2m on one side of a doorway and place a 50cm x 50cm masking tape square .5 m past the doorframe.

For dual-task trials, use the audio file provided, and instruct the participants to say out loud the tone (‘high’ or ‘low’) not the word as sometimes the tones and words will match and sometimes they will not. The goal is to only recite the tone. Please have the patient practice this while seated prior to commencing the protocol. If unable to complete this after two practice trails, please modify the task to only recite the word and ignore the tone. For the final calibration trial, participants will be asked to complete two 10m walks. Please indicate with tape on the floor a 10 m distance.

#### Connect the sensors

Connect the Access Point to the docking station using a Micro USB cable. Connect the external power adapter to the Docking Station and plug it into a power outlet. Connect the Docking Station to your computer using a Micro USB cable. Plug the Opals into the Docking Station in any order, with the port facing down. The Docking Station and Access Point should have a green light when powered on. 
Insert the provided USB drive into your computer to set up the software. 
Double click the setup file. This will guide you through the installation process. After the installation process, click on the Mobility Lab application to launch the program.
